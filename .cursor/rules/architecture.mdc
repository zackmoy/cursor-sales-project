# Architecture Standards (Demo App)

## File Structure
- Services: `src/services/`
- API routes: `src/api/routes/`
- React components: `src/components/`
- Tests: `src/__tests__/` (mirrors source structure)
- Specs: `specs/`

## Stack
- Frontend: Vite + React (TypeScript)
- Backend: Express, TypeScript (run with tsx)
- Validation: Zod for API request bodies

## Conventions
- TypeScript strict mode
- camelCase for functions/variables
- PascalCase for components/classes/types
- kebab-case for filenames
- All API endpoints validated with Zod schemas

## Domain Language
- "workspace" (NOT "organization" or "tenant")
- "analytics" (NOT "metrics" or "stats")
- "export" (NOT "download")
- "member" (NOT "user" or "account")

## Testing
- Unit tests in `src/__tests__/` with vitest
- Map tests to acceptance criteria in specs where applicable

## PR / Spec Traceability
- PR description must reference the spec file in `specs/`
- Tag relevant AEs/SEs from the originating customer calls when known

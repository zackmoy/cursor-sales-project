# Multi-Source Signal Analysis Rules

## Source Processing
- **Gong calls:** Identify each participant as CUSTOMER or PROSPECT. Extract exact quotes, pain points, competitive mentions, buying signals.
- **Canny requests:** Note vote count, top voter companies, request age, current status.
- **Zendesk tickets:** Identify implicit feature requests (workaround patterns), count tickets per theme, note requester companies.

## Triangulation
- Cross-reference by feature/theme across all three sources
- Flag features that appear in ALL THREE sources as CRITICAL
- Flag features in TWO sources as HIGH
- Single-source signals are MEDIUM
- **Do not let "loudest in the room" alone decide.** Weight evidence by the factors below so prioritization reflects role, customer status, and value — not just volume.

## Prioritization factors (use when ranking strength)
- **Role:** Who said it matters. Use Gong participant `title` (and optionally `get_call_participants`): executive/decision-maker (VP, CTO, Director, Head of) > manager (Engineering Manager) > IC (Analyst, Developer). Same quote from a VP blocks more deals than from an IC.
- **Customer status:** Long-time or high-value customers outweigh one-off prospects when the ask is similar. Use **product server `lookup_customer`** by participant email (from Gong parties or Canny/Zendesk): if found, note tier (Starter/Pro/Enterprise), seats, renewal; if not found, treat as prospect. Prefer evidence from existing Enterprise/Pro customers over prospects, and from accounts with renewal or expansion potential.
- **Sales potential / deal context:** When available, factor in deal size or perceived value: tier (Enterprise > Pro > Starter), seats, or Canny voter company value (e.g. `monthlySpend` in Canny live). Deal-blocking language from a large prospect or strategic account raises strength. In real deployments this may come from CRM (e.g. Salesforce); in the demo, use product tier and Canny company data as proxies.

When building the cross-source table, note for each piece of evidence: **who** (role, company), **customer or prospect** (from lookup_customer), and **tier or value proxy** where known. Use that to break ties or upgrade/downgrade strength (e.g. single mention from Enterprise VP + deal-blocking = HIGH even if only one source).

## Signal Strength Rating
- 🔴 CRITICAL: Appears in 3 sources; or deal-blocking from high-value account (e.g. Enterprise customer or large prospect); or strong ask from decision-maker (VP/CTO/Director) in 2+ sources
- 🟡 HIGH: Appears in 2 sources; or mentioned by multiple customers (especially existing tier); or single strong mention from strategic account or exec
- 🟢 MEDIUM: Single source, or multiple mentions but from lower-weight roles/accounts
- ⚪ LOW: Nice-to-have, no urgency, or only from prospects/ICs with no deal context

## Already-Addressed Signals
- Before picking the top feature, check `specs/` for existing spec files and the codebase (`src/`) for already-implemented features. If a feature already has a spec or is already shipped, mark it as DONE in the signal map and move to the next strongest signal.
- Example: if `specs/csv-bulk-export.md` exists and `src/services/export-service.ts` exists, CSV export is shipped — pick the next priority.

## Output Format
1. Cross-source signal map (table showing presence across all channels, noting any DONE features)
2. Per-feature deep dive (evidence from each source, exact quotes)
3. Triangulation summary (why the combined signal is stronger than any single source)
4. Customer quotes (exact words from transcripts, ticket text, Canny descriptions)

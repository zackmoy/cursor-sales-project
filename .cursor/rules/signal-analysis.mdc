# Multi-Source Signal Analysis Rules

## Source Processing
- **Gong calls:** Identify each participant as CUSTOMER or PROSPECT. Extract exact quotes, pain points, competitive mentions, buying signals.
- **Canny requests:** Note vote count, top voter companies, request age, current status.
- **Zendesk tickets:** Identify implicit feature requests (workaround patterns), count tickets per theme, note requester companies.

## Triangulation
- Cross-reference by feature/theme across all three sources
- Flag features that appear in ALL THREE sources as CRITICAL
- Flag features in TWO sources as HIGH
- Single-source signals are MEDIUM
- Weight by: customer tier, deal size, vote count, ticket volume

## Signal Strength Rating
- 🔴 CRITICAL: Appears in 3 sources, or deal-blocking for >$100K prospect
- 🟡 HIGH: Appears in 2 sources, or mentioned by multiple customers
- 🟢 MEDIUM: Single source, single mention
- ⚪ LOW: Nice-to-have, no urgency signals

## Output Format
1. Cross-source signal map (table showing presence across all channels)
2. Per-feature deep dive (evidence from each source, exact quotes)
3. Triangulation summary (why the combined signal is stronger than any single source)
4. Customer quotes (exact words from transcripts, ticket text, Canny descriptions)

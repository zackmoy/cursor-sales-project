# Code standards

- **Readability**: Clear names over clever code. Prefer small functions and explicit control flow.
- **Errors**: Don’t swallow errors. Log and rethrow (or return a typed error) so failures are visible and debuggable.
- **Immutability**: Prefer immutable updates (e.g. spread new objects/arrays) over mutating existing data.
- **Types**: In TypeScript, use proper types for function args and return values; avoid `any` unless necessary and documented.
- **Security**: Validate and sanitize user input. Use parameterized queries for DB access. Never log secrets or put them in client bundles.

Technical Challenge: Cursor Automation Prototype
Overview
Format:
● 30 Minute Live Demo
● 15 Minute Q&A
The Prompt

Build a Cursor-based automation prototype that would provide meaningful value to an enterprise
organization shipping production software.
Your prototype should demonstrate how Cursor can be used to meaningfully improve a
real-world software development workflow.

Expectations
We’re looking for a thoughtful, intentional solution that focuses on solving a well-defined
problem.
Your prototype should clearly demonstrate how Cursor can:
● Improve developer velocity
● Reduce cognitive load
● Increase code quality, safety, or consistency

Strong submissions are well-scoped, opinionated, and grounded in real enterprise constraints.

Example Problem Spaces

These are examples to spark ideas — you’re not limited to these:
● An automated PR review assistant (e.g., policy, security, or architecture checks)
● Context-aware refactoring or migration workflows
● Incident follow-up automation (e.g., logs or tickets → suggested code changes)
● Spec-to-implementation or design-to-code workflows
● Enforcement of internal engineering standards or conventions

During the Live Demo

Please be prepared to:
● Explain the problem you chose and why it matters in an enterprise context
● Walk us through your working prototype
● Discuss key design decisions and tradeoffs
● Highlight limitations and how you would evolve the solution over time

What We’ll Be Evaluating

We’re looking for signals such as:
● Strong problem selection and scoping
● Product and technical judgment
● Clear articulation of enterprise value
● Thoughtfulness around edge cases and risks
● Clarity and confidence in demo and discussion
